This is from (chibi regexp), renamed to (srfi 115) and made sure only
srfi symbols are exported. (chibi char-set boundary) becomes (srfi 115
boundary)

A couple chibi-specific SRE syntax such as digit, => *-> *=> or *$ are
also removed. PCRE tests are removed. regexp-match->sexp is replaced
with regexp-match->list in tests because the former is not part of
(srfi 115). Unicode tests cond-expanded (because Gerbil does not
support it)

115.sld now also supports SRFI-130, which is available in quite many
schemes (and more optimal in Gauche)

(chibi test) is only needed for running the test suites.

Tested with Gauche, Chibi, Larceny, Sagittarius and Gerbil.
